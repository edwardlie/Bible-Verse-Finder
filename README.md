# Verse Search
Swift app to find your favorite bible verse(s)

# The largest heading
In today's digital world, Bible verses are supposed to be easy to find and share especially when multiple verses need to be found. Sometimes finding verses though means having to click through multiple pages or screens. Sharing is a whole different story. This was how VerseSearch was started. Not only can you now search for verses from multiple parts of the bible in one go, you can narrow in your search by using our easily-scrollable list of books and bible verses for each book, and share any verse from the 66 books of the Bible all at the tips of your finger. 

It doesn't just stop there. VerseSearch adds an interactive section to pique your curiosity and appetite for reading, learning, and digesting even more verses in the Bible with a user-generated bible verse quiz that allows you to customize the number of verses you want to be quizzed on and generate a new quiz with new questions on demand. Gone are the moments where you need a bible verse app to read and share verses with and have a little fun while you're at it.
